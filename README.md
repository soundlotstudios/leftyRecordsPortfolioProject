#leftyRecords
Portfolio Project
By Steven Olmos

As a designer with a background in music, I have always been passionate about experiences that combine music and technology. For that reason, I will be building a website for a record label. The goal of the website is to give music fans access to stream and purchase music content from their favorite artists while providing the opportunity to explore similar artists and genres.

Lefty Records has a very extensive music catalog of physical and digital music. Typical record labels focus on targeting one release to its users and providing static content. Lefty Records would have artist landing pages showcasing releases, news, social media, and more. The website would allow users to purchase music in physical and digital forms. It will feature a music player and users would be able to explore new music and favorite songs/albums on their account for purchasing.

Lefty Records can be described as a record label website merged with the capabilities of Soundcloud or Spotify. The key benefit of Lefty Records is to give users the ability to explore new music which in turn could bring more sales. While streaming has taken over the normal music medium, vinyl records and CDs are still alive and well. Combining both mediums would only benefit the business and its users.
